I bought it for my dad and he generally uses it for calls no internet at all and gets about 2 days battery life. With data on it may last for one day. If 4k is ur budget then this is ur phone.

It has default launcher as well as customizations for notification bar.","review14":"* Camera is awesome, takes some great quality pictures.","review11":"* Love the design, Build, Performance.","review12":"* Fastest fingerprint sensor in the market. Finger print sensor ia placed at the back as a button which can be customized for other actions too.","review10":"-------","review48":"I have bought the phone and despite its size, everything else about the phone is absolutely correct. I have not seen any lags about the phone since I have been using for more than 2 months and I always play with heavy games. It is a perfect phone for the price it deserves and the dual camera is also a great feature of the phone.","review49":"I received this phone couple of days ago. The packing was not so good since it was packed only with a small carton without and plastic covering. This is susceptible to water contact. Overall the product was new and in good condition. The seal was unopened. The phone looks more like iphone and the user interface is better than expected. This gives a premium feel fpr users. Camera and sound quality was excellent. The phone gets lil bit heated if your are taking photos for a bit longer period of time. Its wprth the money spent. ??","review46":"6. Has an hybrid sim slot.","review47":"Its pros obviously overcome its cons. You can blindly purchase this device.","review44":"4. No larger storage variant available.","review45":"5. The displays brightness is less than other phones. This creates a problem when using phone in sunlight.","review42":"2. The videography is not good.","review43":"3. No earphones provided by honor.","review40":"CONS:","review41":"1. There is no gorilla glass.","review7":"Slippery without a back cover. With back cover, it looses the premium look.","review39":"7. The IR blaster. You can control a huge amount of devices.","review6":"Single SIM","review5":"Screen size - 5.2 inches","review37":"5. The fingerprint sensor. Honor might have the most customisable fingerprint sensor. It very fast and a lot of features are embedded in it.","review4":"Cons:","review38":"6. Its Full HD display is crisp.","review3":"Cool back fingerprint scanner cum smartkey.","review35":"3. The build quality is excellent. It is surely the most beautiful phone under Rs.30000 category.","review2":"Wonderful phone. Both cameras, front and back, are good. Stylish and premium looks of a double sided glass body. No heating problem so far. Screen On Time is reasonably better for the battery provided. Supports Fast Charging.","review36":"4. The EMUI. It is a very powerful UI. Gives access to a lot of functionality.","review1":"","review33":"2. The speed. It is beast in terms of processing.","review34":"At a price range of under 25000 phones, you can surely go for this phone in terms of processing speeds and cameras. The cameras capture better and real ti life colours. It is better than iphone 6s in terms of colour capture.","review31":"PROS:","review32":"1. The cameras both front and rear.(photography)","review30":"This flagship from honor is a beast! It is superfast in processing and ram management. I am writing its review after 6 months of purchase. It has a good set of cameras for photography. It has an ergonomic design. The fingerprint sensor is the best among any device! Even after 6 months use, this device has not slowed down!","review9":"Pros","review19":"----","review8":"Only one line : This smartphone is the best under 15000rs segment , the camera , performance , audio everything is unmatched , its a near flagship at mid range price with all the intelligent features and looks . The only draw back is that it doesnt have infinity display. The fact that this smartphone can shoot 60 fps video at 1080p and slow motion at 720p speaks for its performance . Gaming is butter smooth.Camera has all the modes , you just name it , the moving picture or live photo mode (apple) , shoot light trail , night mode is awesome , hdr , portrait mode. The low light photography is awesome .There are no camera bumps which is a very rare feature these days and the back is all glass . No youtube channel , no blog will mention honor 8 as the even under the top 10 smartphones under 15000 Rs list. Its completely bizzare , its the best smartphone , beats samsung galaxy s7 in speed test.","review28":"Awesome phone. Comfortable in hand, ui is just great of great its a mixure of ios and android , fast snappy processor, battery backup last for a day easily with moderate using, very vood cameras both but the best part is lot of editing features and modes are given that makes your pics just like these pics taken from a photographer,","review29":"Guys dont hesitate, just grab it","review26":"Fingerprint censer is blazing fast with multifunctions.","review27":"Also liked customisations offered here and there. No leg whatsoever noticed till date.","review24":"Coming from oneplus two... First thing i noticed is the excellent battery life. Has lasted each full day for past two months with one charge.","review25":"Photos are great for stills. Many inbuilt camera effects to play around. Front facing camera is bright and artificial screen flash does help in brigher selfies.","review22":"* No headphones available with the product.","review23":"No noticable flaws with the mobile. Its a good buy for 15K, packed with some heavy features too. People will definitely notice the product as its glass surface is just amazing when light falls on it(Id suggest sapphire blue).","review20":"* Since body is made of glass, phone is very slippery. Make sure you place the phone on a flat surface unless you have purchased a mobile case.","review21":"* Last time when I bought a huawei phone I got a screen guard with it, not this time.

I have not seen any lags about the phone since I have been using for more than 2 months and I always play with heavy games. It is a perfect phone for the price it deserves and the dual camera is also a great feature of the phone.","review49":"I received this phone couple of days ago. The packing was not so good since it was packed only with a small carton without and plastic covering. This is susceptible to water contact. Overall the product was new and in good condition. The seal was unopened. The phone looks more like iphone and the user interface is better than expected. This gives a premium feel fpr users. Camera and sound quality was excellent. The phone gets lil bit heated if your are taking photos for a bit longer period of time. Its wprth the money spent. ??","review46":"6. Has an hybrid sim slot.","review47":"Its pros obviously overcome its cons. You can blindly purchase this device.","review44":"4. No larger storage variant available.","review45":"5.

No earphones provided by honor.","review40":"CONS:","review41":"1. There is no gorilla glass.","review7":"Slippery without a back cover. With back cover, it looses the premium look.","review39":"7.

It is surely the most beautiful phone under Rs.30000 category.","review2":"Wonderful phone. Both cameras, front and back, are good. Stylish and premium looks of a double sided glass body. No heating problem so far. Screen On Time is reasonably better for the battery provided. Supports Fast Charging.","review36":"4. The EMUI. It is a very powerful UI. Gives access to a lot of functionality.","review1":"","review33":"2. The speed. It is beast in terms of processing.","review34":"At a price range of under 25000 phones, you can surely go for this phone in terms of processing speeds and cameras. The cameras capture better and real ti life colours. It is better than iphone 6s in terms of colour capture.","review31":"PROS:","review32":"1. The cameras both front and rear.(photography)","review30":"This flagship from honor is a beast! It is superfast in processing and ram management. I am writing its review after 6 months of purchase. It has a good set of cameras for photography. It has an ergonomic design. The fingerprint sensor is the best among any device! Even after 6 months use, this device has not slowed down!","review9":"Pros","review19":"----","review8":"Only one line : This smartphone is the best under 15000rs segment , the camera , performance , audio everything is unmatched , its a near flagship at mid range price with all the intelligent features and looks . The only draw back is that it doesnt have infinity display. The fact that this smartphone can shoot 60 fps video at 1080p and slow motion at 720p speaks for its performance . Gaming is butter smooth.Camera has all the modes , you just name it , the moving picture or live photo mode (apple) , shoot light trail , night mode is awesome , hdr , portrait mode. The low light photography is awesome .There are no camera bumps which is a very rare feature these days and the back is all glass . No youtube channel , no blog will mention honor 8 as the even under the top 10 smartphones under 15000 Rs list. Its completely bizzare , its the best smartphone , beats samsung galaxy s7 in speed test.","review28":"Awesome phone. Comfortable in hand, ui is just great of great its a mixure of ios and android , fast snappy processor, battery backup last for a day easily with moderate using, very vood cameras both but the best part is lot of editing features and modes are given that makes your pics just like these pics taken from a photographer,","review29":"Guys dont hesitate, just grab it","review26":"Fingerprint censer is blazing fast with multifunctions.","review27":"Also liked customisations offered here and there. No leg whatsoever noticed till date.","review24":"Coming from oneplus two... First thing i noticed is the excellent battery life. Has lasted each full day for past two months with one charge.","review25":"Photos are great for stills. Many inbuilt camera effects to play around. Front facing camera is bright and artificial screen flash does help in brigher selfies.","review22":"* No headphones available with the product.","review23":"No noticable flaws with the mobile. Its a good buy for 15K, packed with some heavy features too. People will definitely notice the product as its glass surface is just amazing when light falls on it(Id suggest sapphire blue).","review20":"* Since body is made of glass, phone is very slippery. Make sure you place the phone on a flat surface unless you have purchased a mobile case.","review21":"* Last time when I bought a huawei phone I got a screen guard with it, not this time.

There is no regret, No disappointment.","review13":"Battery - 9\/10, Software - 10\/10","review14":"RAM and other features - After updating to Nougat it has 800-900 Mb of free RAM. There is enough RAM for a average user. Finger print sensor is good too. It unlocks device with some delay (0.5 seconds) but it is really accurate. Sound quality is good too. There are many sensors like Magnetometer, E Compass, etc.","review11":"Battery & Software - The 3000 mAh battery is sufficient when it is used normally. It lasts about 1.5 days on normal use and with heavy use it may need to be recharged on the same day i.e. withing 24 hours. One negative point is that, its charging speed is too slow. It charges 1% in 2-3 minutes.","review12":"Batter life depends on how you use this phone. As for software it comes with Android 6.0 with No VoLTE support.

Use a third party launcher instead","review41":"Touch response: good","review7":"Performance - The octa core kirin 650 Processor makes sure that phone runs smoothly. I havent noticed any lag in this device while navigating through different apps. I also played some heavy games like Asphalt 8, Mortal Kombat X and I have never spotted any lag in FPS. This device can run all games very smoothly.There is no question on lag when using it normally. You can install as many apps as you like and this phone wont let you down.","review39":"Battery life: 1.5 days easily on heavy usages. Using wifi instead cellular network it gives 2 days backup. Ultra power saving mode is excellent.","review6":"Display - 10\/10","review5":"Display - Display is very sharp and crisp. Also, the touch is so smooth that you will love it while using. It has Full HD Display and it really produces great colors. The 5.2 inch display makes it easier to use it in one hand easily. Also, there is a protection cover (some sort of tempered glass) on the display and it protects the display from dust and fingerprints. For added safety, you can also use another tempered glass. As for me, its not required.","review37":"Call quality: Very good","review4":"Build - 10\/10","review38":"Sound: Speaker sound is decent. Earphone sound is great","review3":"Build - This phone is really a champ when it come to its build quality. Its super thin, only 7.5mm. Its lightweight too. You may need to hold it carefully as it has slippery back (but not too much, only above average). Front looking is not so good but its really nice when it comes to its back looking.Feels premium in hands. I dropped this phone on first day itself and it proved its toughness.No damage was done to body or display when it was dropped from 5 ft to stone floor.","review35":"Display: Bright and very crisp","review2":"I am writing this review after using this device since last 10 days. In those 10 days I tested this device in every mean possible. So here is my detailed (and a short) review ----->>>>","review36":"Camera: It takes sharp and bright picture but colour reproduction is not accurate. Needs improvement.","review1":"","review33":"Summary: This phone is beyond expectations & one wont regret buying this phone...& bonus: Its very cheap with quite good fetaures & you dont have to unnecessarily throw away money for buying phones with sub-par performances. Highly recommended!!","review34":"A good phone in budget with all functions of the costly phones. First of all I have to thank to pricebaba.com because I compared this mobile with all the other mobile phones like Apple vivo Oppo HTC, etc, etc... But the only thing is my financial situation to buy that kind of stuff because they are very much costly, at the moment I come to an conclusion to buy this phone because, when I compare with the all Apple and other costly phones the feature of this phone is good and better than that phone like pixel density camera, RAM, OS Versions processors, Finger print sensors, expandable memory, nano card slots memory card slot, connectivity of JIO SIM, for example when we compare to the Apple iPhone model of the range on \u20B961990 the specification score of Apple iPhone model is 100\/100 but this is up to 63\/100,but we have to see specifications of pixel density of honor is greater than Apple 326 to Apple but 424 for honor 8 smart VEN L22, 7mega pixels for Apple but 8 mega pixels for honor 8 smart VEN L22, the OS version of the Apple phone is only A-ios h is not greater than android 6.0marshmallow for the Apple iPhone there is no card slots but for our honor 8 smart VEN L22 having a card slot, so by this all the other brands of mobile phones of \u20B915000-45000 phones is only equal to honor 8 smart VEN L22 so there is no doubt to buy honor 8 smart VEN L22 and also the manufacturers of the honor 8 smart VEN L22 is huwaie is selling their products all over the world in Europe they are the number 2,they have many research and development centres all over the world and also a research and development centre in banglore and the building cost is 170 million dollars. By this we have to come to the conclusion huwaie, producing goods are best and also they are the oldest manufacturer they are more than 38 years of experience in telecommunications. By this I am guaranteeing this honor 8 smart VEN L22. So there is no doubt of buying this phone. However Honor 8 smart VEN L22 is only smile. Smile in Smart way. Thank you if this article helps you please like this and if you have any doubts please contact me 91 8523975659.","review31":" I hope I helped you.!!! Go for it if you have limited budget (apporx 8000 Rs.). Surely, its better than REDMI 4.","review32":"What a phone! Sleek look, extremely light weight,good camera & functionality as smooth as butter! Performance is very good! Sometimes, nice phones like this get overshadowed in the useless hype of other brands. The phone has unremovable battery. You can use either of these: 1+1 sim or 1 sim+micro sd.","review30":"Nothing else.","review9":"Camera & Storage - it has really nice camera. Front 8mp camera performs well in daylight. In night. Its display brighten up automatically, working as front flash.It can capture decent selfies in dark too. As for 13 MP rear camera, its best I have ever seen. It really performs well in daylight. In night it performance is above average. As for storage, sorry but you need to use an external SD card as internal storage isnt sufficient. You get 8-9 GB of free space after updating to Nougat.","review19":"Excellent display","review8":"Performance - 10\/10","review28":"Charging is slow (Normal)","review29":"Low Storage","review26":"Cons -","review27":"Normal Heating issue when playing games (with Full Brightness) or using camera.","review24":"Nice fingerprint sensor","review25":"Nougat update available as soon as you connect it to internet","review22":"Good Battery Backup","review23":"Excellent camera at this price","review20":"Nice sound quality","review21":"Metal body"},"price":0,"width":{"width5":"width: 9%;","width4":"width: 4%;","width3":"width: 8%;","width2":"width: 26%;","width1":"width: 53%;"},"logo":"img\/logoa.jpg","Id":68,"R&R":"654"},{"imgpath":"tutorial\/spiders\/img\/mobile\/Honor Bee 4G (Gold, 8GB).jpg","Stars":"3.9","link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.in\/Honor-Bee-4G-Gold-8GB\/dp\/B075S6N2FZ\/ref=sr_1_30?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1524450535&sr=1-30&keywords=honor","description":{"description6":"Batteries: : 1 Lithium Polymer batteries required.

Got it for 3999rs and its worth the penny. The phone is slim to my surprise and is lighter even after putting the battery. Screen is the most attractive part. Viewing angles are good and Colors are vivid. Camera is OK for some occasional shots. Beauty mode works well for the front camera. With good lighting one can get some decent shot on both the cameras. I bought it for my dad and he generally uses it for calls no internet at all and gets about 2 days battery life. With data on it may last for one day. If 4k is ur budget then this is ur phone.

(Ignore RAM, most of the people dont really need lots of RAM). If you are getting under 10,000, Just go for it. Its value for money. There is no regret, No disappointment.","review13":"Battery - 9\/10, Software - 10\/10","review14":"RAM and other features - After updating to Nougat it has 800-900 Mb of free RAM. There is enough RAM for a average user. Finger print sensor is good too. It unlocks device with some delay (0.5 seconds) but it is really accurate. Sound quality is good too. There are many sensors like Magnetometer, E Compass, etc.","review11":"Battery & Software - The 3000 mAh battery is sufficient when it is used normally. It lasts about 1.5 days on normal use and with heavy use it may need to be recharged on the same day i.e. withing 24 hours. One negative point is that, its charging speed is too slow. It charges 1% in 2-3 minutes.","review12":"Batter life depends on how you use this phone. As for software it comes with Android 6.0 with No VoLTE support. After updating it to Android 7.0 it gets VoLTE ability too. You can download themes from theme store and there are many options for customization.","review10":"Camera - 10\/10, Storage - 7\/10","review51":"- EMUI 5.0 OS 5 out of 4 (batter then MIUI OS)","review52":"Note:- OTG not supported","review50":"- Battery 5 out of 4","review48":"- Camera 5 out of 5","review49":"- Display 5 out of 5 (Full HD)","review46":"- Design 5 out of 5 (Slim)","review47":"- Performance 5 out of 5","review44":"Instead of going to mi 3s or any other phone in this price range, better to buy this one because the original price was 20000 but due to huge price drop its available for just 7500.","review45":" Camera quality is good, Screen quality is the best, very light in weight and has all up to date feature with latest android nougat","review42":"Build: Light weight and very slim and built quality is very good. Feels like premium.","review43":"Overall good phone","review40":"UI: Didnt like it much. Use a third party launcher instead","review41":"Touch response: good","review7":"Performance - The octa core kirin 650 Processor makes sure that phone runs smoothly. I havent noticed any lag in this device while navigating through different apps. I also played some heavy games like Asphalt 8, Mortal Kombat X and I have never spotted any lag in FPS. This device can run all games very smoothly.There is no question on lag when using it normally. You can install as many apps as you like and this phone wont let you down.","review39":"Battery life: 1.5 days easily on heavy usages. Using wifi instead cellular network it gives 2 days backup. Ultra power saving mode is excellent.","review6":"Display - 10\/10","review5":"Display - Display is very sharp and crisp. Also, the touch is so smooth that you will love it while using. It has Full HD Display and it really produces great colors. The 5.2 inch display makes it easier to use it in one hand easily. Also, there is a protection cover (some sort of tempered glass) on the display and it protects the display from dust and fingerprints. For added safety, you can also use another tempered glass. As for me, its not required.","review37":"Call quality: Very good","review4":"Build - 10\/10","review38":"Sound: Speaker sound is decent. Earphone sound is great","review3":"Build - This phone is really a champ when it come to its build quality. Its super thin, only 7.5mm. Its lightweight too. You may need to hold it carefully as it has slippery back (but not too much, only above average). Front looking is not so good but its really nice when it comes to its back looking.Feels premium in hands. I dropped this phone on first day itself and it proved its toughness.No damage was done to body or display when it was dropped from 5 ft to stone floor.","review35":"Display: Bright and very crisp","review2":"I am writing this review after using this device since last 10 days. In those 10 days I tested this device in every mean possible. So here is my detailed (and a short) review ----->>>>","review36":"Camera: It takes sharp and bright picture but colour reproduction is not accurate. Needs improvement.","review1":"","review33":"Summary: This phone is beyond expectations & one wont regret buying this phone...& bonus: Its very cheap with quite good fetaures & you dont have to unnecessarily throw away money for buying phones with sub-par performances. Highly recommended!!","review34":"A good phone in budget with all functions of the costly phones. First of all I have to thank to pricebaba.com because I compared this mobile with all the other mobile phones like Apple vivo Oppo HTC, etc, etc... But the only thing is my financial situation to buy that kind of stuff because they are very much costly, at the moment I come to an conclusion to buy this phone because, when I compare with the all Apple and other costly phones the feature of this phone is good and better than that phone like pixel density camera, RAM, OS Versions processors, Finger print sensors, expandable memory, nano card slots memory card slot, connectivity of JIO SIM, for example when we compare to the Apple iPhone model of the range on \u20B961990 the specification score of Apple iPhone model is 100\/100 but this is up to 63\/100,but we have to see specifications of pixel density of honor is greater than Apple 326 to Apple but 424 for honor 8 smart VEN L22, 7mega pixels for Apple but 8 mega pixels for honor 8 smart VEN L22, the OS version of the Apple phone is only A-ios h is not greater than android 6.0marshmallow for the Apple iPhone there is no card slots but for our honor 8 smart VEN L22 having a card slot, so by this all the other brands of mobile phones of \u20B915000-45000 phones is only equal to honor 8 smart VEN L22 so there is no doubt to buy honor 8 smart VEN L22 and also the manufacturers of the honor 8 smart VEN L22 is huwaie is selling their products all over the world in Europe they are the number 2,they have many research and development centres all over the world and also a research and development centre in banglore and the building cost is 170 million dollars. By this we have to come to the conclusion huwaie, producing goods are best and also they are the oldest manufacturer they are more than 38 years of experience in telecommunications. By this I am guaranteeing this honor 8 smart VEN L22. So there is no doubt of buying this phone. However Honor 8 smart VEN L22 is only smile. Smile in Smart way. Thank you if this article helps you please like this and if you have any doubts please contact me 91 8523975659.","review31":" I hope I helped you.!!! Go for it if you have limited budget (apporx 8000 Rs.). Surely, its better than REDMI 4.","review32":"What a phone! Sleek look, extremely light weight,good camera & functionality as smooth as butter! Performance is very good! Sometimes, nice phones like this get overshadowed in the useless hype of other brands. The phone has unremovable battery. You can use either of these: 1+1 sim or 1 sim+micro sd.","review30":"Nothing else.","review9":"Camera & Storage - it has really nice camera. Front 8mp camera performs well in daylight. In night. Its display brighten up automatically, working as front flash.It can capture decent selfies in dark too. As for 13 MP rear camera, its best I have ever seen. It really performs well in daylight. In night it performance is above average. As for storage, sorry but you need to use an external SD card as internal storage isnt sufficient. You get 8-9 GB of free space after updating to Nougat.","review19":"Excellent display","review8":"Performance - 10\/10","review28":"Charging is slow (Normal)","review29":"Low Storage","review26":"Cons -","review27":"Normal Heating issue when playing games (with Full Brightness) or using camera.","review24":"Nice fingerprint sensor","review25":"Nougat update available as soon as you connect it to internet","review22":"Good Battery Backup","review23":"Excellent camera at this price","review20":"Nice sound quality","review21":"Metal body"},"price":0,"width":{"width5":"width: 9%;","width4":"width: 4%;","width3":"width: 8%;","width2":"width: 26%;","width1":"width: 53%;"},"logo":"img\/logoa.jpg","Id":90,"R&R":"654"},{"imgpath":"tutorial\/spiders\/img\/mobile\/Honor 7X (Black, 4GB RAM + 64GB memory).jpg","Stars":"3.8","link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.in\/Honor-Black-4GB-64GB-memory\/dp\/B077PTJT5Z\/ref=sr_1_12\/258-3105428-2619850?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1524450491&sr=1-12&keywords=honor","description":{"description6":"Batteries: : 1 A batteries required.

IR blaster is a bonus feature, which is not supported by many phone these days..","review19":"Memory 128GB","review8":"Everything works perfectly. I bought the activity monitor and the case from the HONOR website and pairing is quite simple. Now I can track fitness and sleep very well. The user interface is special considering that I have used ONE PLUS ONE, MICROMAX YUREKA and Samsung phones before. It is simple and intuitive and there are many other new features in the settings which you can activate. No hindrance to any of the apps.","review7":"Only very minor cons are that it is very slippery and that it sometimes get very warm to touch.","review17":"Performance 10\/10","review6":"This H8Pro easily beats in all aspects my earlier Nexus 6 bought at 42k which I used for 2 years.","review18":"Battery 10\/10","review5":"I have been using this phone for the last 4 months. It is a brilliant phone with absolutely no lag, a full day battery and an excellent camera. Its software is very stable and I ran this phone without a single restart for 100 days after which I accidentally restarted it trying to eject the sim card tray.","review15":"Look 10\/10","review4":"Excellent phone at reasonable price. Specially battery backup and processor speed. The phone is powered with 4000 mAH battery which is amazing. Normal usage for 2 days without charging is quite usual for it. I am using this phone for last 8 days. Moreover, I feel absolutely no heating problem, which is common with many of the existing budget phones in the market. Thanks to Huawei!!!","review16":"Camera 10\/10 (Dual lenses* Rear)","review3":"One of the Best available Hand set in the Market. I have done a lot of research on the net before ordering this product . I have been using this for the past 2 days. Perfect for day to day use. Very slim, premium Design. Better than few of the models available in range 30-60K. Specs. are excellent . Blindly go for it.","review13":"HONOR 8 PRO is quite sleek, just 6.97mm in thickness, and has curved sides.","review24":"Buy it","review2":"The phone is marvelous as expected got oreo update too. From Camera to performance wise best in class and battery back up is too amazing. Yesterday morning i received this phone and did full charge and after heavy use of watching videos, playing games, downloading movies and upgrading to Oreo i am writing this review at 47% of battery life. Was always a Huawei fan and will always be. Will recommend this to my colleagues too. Forget Vivo, Oppo, MI, Motorola, Nokia and all under 30K just go for 8 Pro blindly","review14":"Surprising is that it has 4000mAh battery into this body.","review1":"","review11":"Bought this phone during first week of April. I would say that its an average phone. Specs are good. Theres no heating issue. I updated to Oreo and I am not facing heating issue. Camera is good. Sound quality through 3.5mm jack is awesome. But the sound quality through the speaker is worst, you will get to hear tinny sound through speakers.","review22":"What else yu need.","review12":"Now comes the worst part, the Battery. Even though it has 4000mah, the battery drains very quickly. I get max of 16 hours and I am not happy with it. Theres no software optimisation for battery whatsoever. Some days I get only 12 hours with moderate usage. My main point in buying this phone was its battery but it has disappointed me. This is my daily runner and due to its incapable battery life, I am finding it difficult with this phone. Guys if you are looking at a phone with a better battery life then dont buy this phone. If you buy this phone then you have to buy a power bank to carry along with you all d time. The next bad part is the charging tine. Huawei advertises that it is capable of fast charging but it takes 2.5 hours to charge from 5% to 100%. I dont think this is fast charging. this has slowest fast charging. With an incapable battery that cant last for an entire day, at least Huawei should have provided real fast charging. I am disappointed with Honor 8 pro.","review23":"Dont think.","review20":"Ram 6GB","review10":"Highly recommended...","review21":"At the front, theres a 5.7-inch LTPS panel, with super-slim side borders."},"price":22999,"width":{"width5":"width: 9%;","width4":"width: 4%;","width3":"width: 6%;","width2":"width: 18%;","width1":"width: 63%;"},"logo":"img\/logoa.jpg","Id":128,"R&R":"2,786"},{"imgpath":"tutorial\/spiders\/img\/mobile\/Honor 7X (Gold, 4GB RAM + 32GB memory).jpg","Stars":"3.8","link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.in\/Honor-Gold-4GB-32GB-memory\/dp\/B077PXTKSN\/ref=sr_1_7\/258-3105428-2619850?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1524450491&sr=1-7&keywords=honor","description":{"description6":"Batteries: : 1 Lithium Polymer batteries required.
